## Loading and preprocessing the data
load data from local csv file
```{R, echo = TRUE}
unzip('activity.zip')
d1 <- read.csv('activity.csv', sep=',', header = TRUE)
str(d1)
```
the data loaded has 3 variables including:
- **steps**: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval
- **date**: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **interval**: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken

it has 17568 observations but some values missingï¼Œand the variable data need to be transform to Date type.
```{R, echo = TRUE}
d1$date <- as.Date(d1$date)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{R, echo = TRUE}
library(dplyr)
sp <- group_by(d1, date)
sp <- as.data.frame(summarize(sp, mean=mean(steps),median = median(steps), total=sum(steps)))
sp
```
we've got **total,mean and median** of steps per day all in  data frame named **sp**,it has 61 rows

let's maek a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day by ggplot2

```{R, echo = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
g <- ggplot(sp,aes(x= total))
g + geom_histogram() + labs(x= 'Number of steps', 
                            y = 'Frequency', 
                            title= 'Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day')
```
## What is the average daily activity pattern?
calculate average steps of the 5-minute interval across all days then sort data by mean variable
```{R, echo = TRUE}
si <- group_by(d1, interval)
si <- as.data.frame(summarize(si, mean=mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE),))
si[order(si$mean, decreasing = TRUE),]
```
the  **835**th interval has the maximum number of steps, let's draw plot
```{R, echo = TRUE}
g2 <- ggplot(si,aes(interval,mean))
g2 + geom_line() + labs(title = 'Average Daily Activity Pattern',
                        x = '5-minute intervals',
                        y = 'Avarage number of steps taken')
```


## Imputing missing values
check which variable has missing values
```{R, echo = TRUE}
sapply(d1,anyNA)
```
only steps has NAs

find the number of rows which has missing values
```{R, echo = TRUE}
Nat <- sum(is.na(d1))
Nat
```
the dataset has **2304** rows with missing value

use the mean for that 5-minute interval to fill these NAs
```{R, echo = TRUE}
m <- merge(d1[is.na(d1),],si,by = 'interval')
d2 <- d1[,]
d2[is.na(d2),'steps'] <- m$mean
head(d2[is.na(d1),],10)
```
now we've filled all missing values and saved to the new dataset **d2** then compare with the first part's results

use **d2** calculate the mean, total and median as we do before
```{R, echo = TRUE}
sp2 <- group_by(d2, date)
sp2 <- as.data.frame(summarize(sp2, mean=mean(steps),median = median(steps), total=sum(steps)))
cp_sp <- merge(sp, sp2, by = 'date')
##cp_sp <- cp_sp %>%  mutate(mean_comp = mean.y-mean.x, total_comp =  total.y-total.x, median_comp = median.y-median.x) %>% select(date, total_comp, median_comp, mean_comp)
cp_sp
```
the median , mean and total are the **same** as the results of the first part 

plot the total number of steps taken each day
```{R, echo = TRUE}
g3 <- ggplot(sp2,aes(x= total))
g3 + geom_histogram() + labs(x= 'Number of steps', 
                            y = 'Frequency', 
                            title= 'Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day')
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
make a new dataset **dw** which has week_cat variable that divide the data into "weekday" or "weekend"
```{R, echo = TRUE}
dw <- d2 %>% mutate(week_cat = factor(weekdays(date),
                                levels = c('Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday','Saturday','Sunday'),
                                labels = c('weekday','weekday','weekday','weekday','weekday','weekend','weekend')))
dw[dw$week_cat=='weekday',]
```
Make a panel plot containing a time series plot  of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days
```{R, echo = TRUE}
si2 <- group_by(dw, interval, week_cat)
si2 <- as.data.frame(summarize(si2, mean=mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE)))

g3 <- ggplot(si2,aes(interval,mean))
g3 + geom_line() + facet_grid(week_cat~.) + labs(title = 'Activity patterns on weekdays and weekends',
                                                 x = '5-minute intervals',
                                                 y = 'Avarage number of steps taken')
```
